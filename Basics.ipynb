    "We see that for people earning less than 150,000 dollars, around 41 percent are not willing to travel at all, while 48 percent of people earning more than 150,000 dollars prefer not to move. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that people earning more than 150,000 dollars are more prone to host Thanksgiving at their residence than those earning less. \n",

    "Additionaly, those earning less are more willing to travel for a few hours than those earning more (if Thanksgiving is out of town but not too far). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if Thansgiving is far away, those earning less are less prone to travel than those earning more, likely due to moving and traveling costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that people earning less than 150,000 dollars are not very prone to host Thanksgiving but are willing to travel only if Thanksgiving isn't located too far seems to suggest that these people tend to be young people traveling to their hometown to celebrate Thanksgiving with their families. Conversely,the people who earn more and yet are less likely to travel small distances seem to fit the profile of parents who host Thanksgiving in their house.\n",

    "In order to confirm that the Thanksgiving hosts are more likely to be parents and that those traveling are more likely to be young people traveling to their hometown, it'd be interesting to analyze the relationship between the \"Age\" column and the \"int_income\" column."

    "Looking at the index \"Have you ever tried to meet up with hometown friends on Thanksgiving night?\", we can already assume that the people who responded \"Yes\" to that question either live in their hometown or have travelled back home. We observe that the people who celebrate Thanksgiving and meet up hometown friends are much younger than those who meet up with homewtown friends but don't celebrate Friendsgiving. This suggests that younger people are more prone to celebrate Friendsgiving than older people (such as parents), regardless of the actual location of Friendsgiving. This thus explains why the people who don't celebrate Friendsgiving, whether they meet up with hometown friends or not, are around the same age group. Additionally, the analysis also suggests that any activity related to meeting friends (whether it is Friendsgiving or meeting up hometown friends), is usually performed by younger people, while older people's Thanksgiving revolves more around family members.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also observe a correlation between the age of the participants and their income. The younger they are, the less income they earn. Thus, the older age group, conveniently the higher income group, neither celebrate Friendsgiving nor meet up with friends during Thanksgiving, reinforcing the hypothesis that those people already live in their hometown and host Thanksgiving themselves. Conversely, the younger people, and those who earn less, are much more likely to celebrate Friendsgiving and travel back to their hometown to celebrate Thanksgiving with their families."
